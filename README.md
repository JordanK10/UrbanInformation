# Urban Information Project

This project focuses on the **validation and methodological development** of information inference techniques for analyzing urban income dynamics and socioeconomic mobility.

## Project Focus

This project contains the **validation framework** and **methodological development** components, including:

- **`data/validation/`**: Complete validation framework with dummy data generation and testing
- **Methodological scripts**: Core SSM models and inference algorithms
- **Validation plots**: Comprehensive testing and validation visualizations

## Companion Project

The **`urbandata`** project contains the **application** of these methods to real-world ACS data, including:

- Real-world data analysis scripts
- Urban income dynamics analysis
- Socioeconomic mobility studies
- Geographic and temporal analysis tools

## Validation Framework

The validation framework includes multiple test environments:
- **`validation_simplest/`**: Basic validation setup
- **`validation_dynamic_p/`**: Dynamic probability environment testing
- **`validation_dynamic_p_l/`**: Dynamic probability and outcomes testing

## Usage

This project is designed for:
- Developing and testing new inference methodologies
- Validating model performance on synthetic data
- Methodological research and development
- Algorithm optimization and testing

For real-world data analysis, see the companion `urbandata` project.
